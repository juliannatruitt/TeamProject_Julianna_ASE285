### Pagination for Time
* UI - page will show a selected number (around 10-15 depending on layout) tasks per page
* Button at bottom to seek (TBD but possibly arrows instead of numbers depending on rest of UI) 

### Completed Tasks
* Create an API ('/completed') to show all completed tasks
* UI - button to complete
* Back-end-> boolean isComplete = true or false and updated in DB
